Sure! Here’s a sample `README.md` for your tool **MoveSync**, assuming it's a command-line PostgreSQL migration utility using Python:

---

# MoveSync

**MoveSync** is a lightweight IT migration tool designed to streamline database migrations. Currently, it supports **PostgreSQL** migrations and offers a scriptable, customizable interface for managing data transfer between PostgreSQL instances.

---

## Features

* 📦 Migrate data between PostgreSQL databases
* ⚙️ Multi-threaded processing for performance
* 🐘 Built using SQLAlchemy for efficient database handling
* 📊 Tabular logs and clear CLI output
* 🧪 Easily extensible for future support of other database systems

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* PostgreSQL access (source and destination)
* pip (Python package installer)

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movesync.git
cd movesync
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python movesync.py [options]
```

Options are defined using `docopt`. Example usage might look like:

```bash
python movesync.py --source-db postgresql://user:pass@host1/db1 --dest-db postgresql://user:pass@host2/db2
```

You can define your CLI arguments as needed in the script.
